My personal Arquillian showcase.

Application contains application logic, as described in the application/README.md
Each project contains test for specific containers

application/ folder contains app itself with application-[server_name] being variations and fine tuning to adhere to concrete server configuration requirements.
arq-xxx folders contain Arquillian tests running for given container
